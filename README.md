Kodi video plugin for Amiko Alien 2 with Spark as operative system

Install the plug-in, configure the local IP of your Amiko Alien 2, launch the plugin, enjoy!

This plugin was developed and tested on an Amiko Alien 2 triple tuner having Spark as operative system (firmware ver. 1.2.73) and WebTV enabled. It could work to other similar Amiko products too.

The development of this pluging was due to the monitoring of the HTTP traffic generated by the official Spark Android client app.
